      Im just a poor boy from a poor family
    Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I play dota or something good. <p>I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true
(I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you</p>
